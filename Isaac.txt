Before: I was working on the front-end creating login and register pages.
I was trying to connect the front-end and back-end and I eventually
managed.

During holidays: I was working on the APIs testing them making sure, they work as intended.

Currently: I'm creating services for the REST API and trying to 
share data across components.
